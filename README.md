This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Overview

This app has been converted to put together multiple uses cases for app development. In addition to library nextjs 
starter project consist, more library has been added to refine specific use case for app development.

 - Typescript - This library has been added to this starter file to provide type safety to javascript
 - Styled-Component - This allows for the customization of components using css https://styled-components.com/
 - Material-UI -  React Component UI
 - SCSS - global css styling framework
 - Styled-Icon - Collection of icons based on styled components

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `src/pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.js`.

The `src/pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.
